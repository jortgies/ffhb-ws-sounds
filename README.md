### FreiFunk (Hansestadt) Bremen WebSocket sounds

![FLASH!](https://flash.timi.one/images/flash-gordon.jpg "Flash Gordon")

## About
### Why?
We were drunk, flashing routers and had fun singing the Flash Gordon theme... So [Louis](https://github.com/lokn) came up with the idea of this and [Jan-Eric](https://github.com/jortgies) built it.

### What?
Everyone opens the website, someone hits the button and everyone hears "Flash! Aha!". Try it on [flash.timi.one](https://flash.timi.one)!

## Requirements
* nodejs
* npm

## Installation
* git clone this repo
* cd into the repo
* `npm install`
* `node app.js`
* The service is available on localhost:3001. Running in a screen/tmux is recommended as well as a reverse proxy.

### ToDo
* More sounds! See "Issues".
* UI
